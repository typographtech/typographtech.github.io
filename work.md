# Past work

## Mathesar (Tech Lead)
**Mathesar** is an open‑source, self‑hosted web application that makes working with **PostgreSQL** simple for teams of all skill levels. It provides a familiar, spreadsheet‑like interface for viewing, editing, querying, and collaborating on data—while keeping data **on your own servers** and using **native Postgres roles and privileges** for access control.

**What this demonstrates for clients**
- Building **product-quality data tools** on top of existing databases (Postgres-first, minimal abstraction).
- Leading delivery across a multi-language stack (**Svelte/TypeScript + Python/Django + Postgres**).
- Designing usable workflows for non-technical users (tables, relationships, query builder “explorations”, forms).
- Operating in open source: shipping, reviews, coordination with a broad contributor community.

## CC Catalog / CC Search Catalog (Senior Data Engineer)
**CC Catalog** (archived/transfered to WordPress as **Openverse Catalog**) is an open-source data pipeline project focused on **identifying and collecting Creative Commons–licensed works at web scale**. It combined large-scale processing of **Common Crawl** data with ETL jobs pulling from public APIs, producing structured outputs used downstream for search and indexing.

**What this demonstrates for clients**
- Designing and operating **large-scale data pipelines** (web-scale ingestion, transformation, and outputs suitable for indexing).
- Practical distributed processing with **Apache Spark** on AWS EMR (parsing crawl metadata and extracting signals).
- Workflow orchestration and scheduled ETL using **Apache Airflow** (daily and monthly jobs).
- Production-minded engineering: reproducible pipelines, clear workflow boundaries, and data-quality considerations.
